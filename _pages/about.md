I am a Ph.D. candidate at the faculty of [Data and Decisions Science](http://dds.technion.ac.il/) of the [Technion â€“ Israel Institute of Technology](http://www.technion.ac.il/). My advisor is Professor [Roi Reichart](https://ie.technion.ac.il/~roiri/), and I am honored to be a [Clore fellow](https://clorefoundation.org.il/clore-scholars-programme/). Before that, I graduated with my B.Sc. in Data Science and Engineering from the Technion and was awarded the [Schulich Leaders](https://schulichleaders.com/) scholarship.
<br><br>
My research is in the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and lies in the intersection of Domain Adaptation, Causal Inference, and Language Generation. Specifically, I develop causal-inspired methods to improve out-of-distribution generalization, interpretability, and reliability of NLP systems. I am also working on developing NLP technology for scientific modelling in  brain, cognitive and mental health sciences.
Check my [blog post](/blogs/2024-11-10-nlp4science) on this topic.
